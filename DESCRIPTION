Title: Use a Single BibTeX File in Multiple Places Easily
Version: 0.1.0.9001
Author: Zachary S.L. Foster
Maintainer: Zachary S.L. Foster <zacharyfoster1989@gmail.com>
Description: This is an R package to help using a single BibTeX file in multiple places throughout a file system without relying on a static directory structure. This allows you to use a single BibTeX file and document library (e.g. a directory with PDFs) for all R markdown documents in directory and their sub directories, even if the directory or its sub directories are moved/renamed. It also helps linking and organizing PDFs (or other documents) associated with a citation, so you can have a single location for all PDFs. Its intended use is taking notes in R markdown.
